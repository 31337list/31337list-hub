To use this just download the zip, extract, and load it into your browser via edge://extensions/ or chrome://extensions/ or whatever.

All it currently does is show the same menu as 31337list but open all links in new tabs

I basically made this entirely for myself, but I might as well put the code here in case anyone wants to use this
